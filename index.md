## Overview
_The problem:_ UH Mānoa has hundreds of active clubs. However, it can be difficult for new students to find information about potential clubs they want to join. 

_The solution:_ Mānoa Club Hunt is an application to aid students in their hunt for clubs to join. It will provide students with a directory of clubs containing club information, club meeting location/times, club website link, and club contact information.

## Approach
Mānoa Club Hunt will have three different accounts roles, users, club admins and site admins.
Each club will be tagged with what interests their club is about. 
Users will be able to search and join clubs they are interested in, and recieve notifications about their clubs activities.
Club admins will be able to post activities about their club, change the description, page and interests of the club and monitor the activities of their club members.
Site admins will grant club admin status to users, ensure the site is working correctly and make sure there is no inappropriate or illicit activity happening on the site.
