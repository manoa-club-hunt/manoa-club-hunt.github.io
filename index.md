## Overview
_The problem:_ UH Mānoa has hundreds of active clubs. However, it can be difficult for new students to find information about potential clubs they want to join. 

_The solution:_ Mānoa Club Hunt is an application to aid students in their hunt for clubs to join. It will provide students with a directory of clubs containing club information, club meeting location/times, club website link, and club contact information.

## Approach
Mānoa Club Hunt will have three different user roles: users, club admins, and site admins. 

Users will be able to search and join clubs they are interested in, and recieve notifications about the club's activities. 

Club Admins will be able to edit their club page i.e., post club activities, change the description, change interest areas; and can monitor the activities of their club members. 

Site Admins will grant Club Admin privileges to users, ensure the site is running properly, and ensure that there isn't inappropriate and/or illicit activity happening on the site.

Clubs will be listed by alphabetical order, but can also sorted by interest areas as well. Each club will be tagged with their corresponding interest areas.
