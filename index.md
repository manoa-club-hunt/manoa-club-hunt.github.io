## Overview
_The problem:_ UH Mﾄ］oa has hundreds of active clubs. However, it can be difficult for new students to find information about potential clubs they want to join. 

_The solution:_ Mﾄ］oa Club Hunt will provide students with a directory of clubs containing club information, club meeting location and times, club website links, and club contact information. 
Users will be able to join clubs and receive notifications about the club.
Clubs will be able to send out notifications to their club members through Mﾄ］oa Club Hunt. 

## Approach
Mﾄ］oa Club Hunt will have three different user roles: users, club admins, and site admins. 

Users will be able to search and join clubs they are interested in, and recieve notifications about the club's activities. 

Club Admins will be able to edit their club page i.e., post club activities, change the description, change interest areas; and can monitor the activities of their club members. 

Site Admins will grant Club Admin privileges to users, ensure the site is running properly, and ensure that there isn't inappropriate and/or illicit activity happening on the site.

Clubs will be listed by alphabetical order, but can also be sorted by interest areas as well. Each club will be tagged with their corresponding interest areas.

Visitors will be able to search through clubs without making an account, but visitors will need to make an account to utilize the user privileges.
