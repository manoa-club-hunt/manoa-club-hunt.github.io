## Overview
_The problem:_ UH Mānoa has hundreds of active clubs. However, it can be difficult for new students to find information about potential clubs they want to join. 

_The solution:_ Mānoa Club Hunt will provide students with a directory of clubs containing club information, club meeting location and times, club website links, and club contact information. 
Users will be able to join clubs and receive notifications about the club.
Clubs will be able to send out notifications to their club members through Mānoa Club Hunt.
